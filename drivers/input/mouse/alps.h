 * @command_mode_resp: For V3/V4 touchpads, the final byte of the EC response
 *   (aka command mode response) identifies the firmware minor version.  This
 *   can be used to distinguish different hardware models which are not
 *   uniquely identifiable through their E7 responses.
 * @proto_version: Indicates V1/V2/V3/...
 * @byte0: Helps figure out whether a position report packet matches the
 *   known format for this model.  The first byte of the report, ANDed with
 *   mask0, should match byte0.
 * @mask0: The mask used to check the first byte of the report.
 * @flags: Additional device capabilities (passthrough port, trackstick, etc.).
 *
 * Many (but not all) ALPS touchpads can be identified by looking at the
 * values returned in the "E7 report" and/or the "EC report."  This table
 * lists a number of such touchpads.
